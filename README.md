# Hospital-Workflow-Analysis
1. Papollo Hospital – Work & Leads Workflow Analysis

   This project showcases an end-to-end Power BI dashboard built to analyze hospital operations, patient workflows, and revenue trends.
   It covers the complete journey from admission → discharge → follow-up → billing, enabling hospital administrators to monitor occupancy, diagnosis distribution, doctor feedback volumes, and financial              performance.

   The dashboard provides clear visibility into patient timelines, bed allocation, diagnosis frequency, and insurance vs billing trends — helping improve operational efficiency, resource management, and patient     care quality.

2. Purpose of the Project

     🔹 To understand trends in admissions, discharges, follow-ups, and billing amounts

     🔹 To analyze bed occupancy across Private, General, and ICU wards

     🔹 To track patient diagnoses and identify the most common medical conditions

     🔹 To compare billing amount vs health insurance claim amount for financial insights

     🔹 To enhance decision-making for hospital management using data-driven insights

3. Tech Stack

     🔹 Power BI Desktop

     🔹 Power Query for data cleaning & ETL

     🔹 Excel / CSV files as source data

4. Data Source

   The dataset was taken from a YouTube channel providing sample healthcare datasets
   for Power BI practice.

5. Key Features / Dashboard Highlights
   
   🔹 Patient Journey Overview

      Time slicer for analyzing performance across different periods.

   🔹 Bed Occupancy Analysis

       Insights across 3 Ward Types:

       Ward Type	Occupancy

       Private	~3,500 beds

       General	~2,300 beds

       ICU	~1,000 beds

       Shows which ward category has the highest patient load.

    🔹 Diagnosis Type Distribution

       Most common diagnoses include:

       Viral Infection (Highest – 100%)

       Flu

       Malaria – 1.43K patients

       Typhoid – 1.15K patients

       Pneumonia – 0.57K patients

       Fracture – 0.29K patients

       Helpful for identifying seasonal disease patterns and resource requirements.

   🔹 Doctor Feedback Volume

       Visual donut chart showing equal feedback volume (1.02K each) for doctors:

       Useful for assessing patient engagement & doctor performance patterns.

   🔹 Financial Insights – Billing vs Insurance

       Comparison across major diagnosis categories:Diagnosis	Billing	Insurance

       Shows how much of the billed amount is covered by insurance.

6. Useful Insights

    🔹 Viral infections and flu are the most common diagnoses

    🔹 Private wards have the highest bed occupancy

    🔹 Total billing amount is ₹190.43M, indicating high patient load

    🔹 Insurance coverage closely follows billing amounts → indicates effective claim processing

    🔹 Doctor feedback volume distribution shows consistent patient engagement across doctors

    🔹 Fracture and Pneumonia have significantly lower patient counts compared to other conditions

7. What I Learned

    🔹 Designing a healthcare-focused Power BI dashboard

    🔹 Creating KPI cards, donut charts, bar charts, and financial comparison visuals

    🔹 Building interactive slicers for date-range analysis

    🔹 Improving UX through color themes, icons, and layout

    🔹 Understanding hospital workflows and operational metrics
